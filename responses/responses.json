  "breastfeeding_frequency": [
    "After the first week, babies continue to need to nurse when they show signs of hunger. Their caloric needs will continue to increase. By nursing your baby every time he or she signals his or her hunger, your body will increase production to meet your baby’s needs.",
    "There will be times when your baby seems to want to nurse more often; this is very normal. Many people call these times “growth spurts,”.  No matter what you call them, your baby’s increase in feeding frequency will stimulate your body to build your milk supply, and your nursing will generally soothe your baby.",
    "Every baby is different, and every mother is different. Some mothers have larger storage capacities than others, so one baby may get more milk in one nursing session than another; that may mean a longer time between nursing sessions. Exclusively breastfed infants—which means your baby is receiving nothing but your milk, not even water—tend to nurse about 8 times a day, with a range from 4 to 13 sessions per day.",
    "Many babies who start out nursing quite often in the first month nurse less often as they become more efficient and as the mother’s milk supply increases to meet their needs."
